			        <p><strong>Theorist:</strong> Fred Siebert, Theodore Peterson and Wilbur Schramm 1956 </p>
		          <p>&nbsp;</p>
			        <p><strong>Theory Explanation:</strong> Generally, media theories refer to the relationships between the media and the society, along with the social, political and philosophical principles that govern these entities. Normative theories, in turn, deal with what the media ought to do in society rather than what it actually does. They deal specifically with who controls the media. </p>
			        <blockquote>
			          <p>&nbsp;</p>
		          </blockquote>
			        <p>The theorists defined the Four Theories of the Press based on the socio-political structures it operates on:  <br>
		            (1) The Authoritarian Theory, where the government or the autocratic ruling authorities control the media;  <br>
		            (2) The Soviet Theory, where the media is free to write what it wants but has to conform to the communist ideology of the state;  <br>
		            (3) Libertarian Theory, where the Press is completely free from any government restrictions;  <br>
		            (4) Social Responsibility Theory, where the Press is a modified version of free press theory but with an emphasis on accountability to society.   <br>
		            <br>
		            The non-aligned countries, which were committed to social and economic development on their own terms, discarding the existing socio-political models. Hence two more theories were added:</p>
			        <p>&nbsp;</p>
			        <p>Development Communication Theory: This theory states that there can be no development without communication. According to this theory, the media was considered to be responsible in carrying out developmental programmes, and also governed by certain rules and restriction from the state. The weakness of this theory is that 'development' is often equated with government propaganda.     </p>
			        <p>&nbsp;</p>
			        <p>Democratization/Democratic Participant Media Theory: This theory opposes the commercialization of the media, at the same time resists bureaucratic control of the media.</p>
			        <p>&nbsp;</p>
			        <p><strong>Theory Application/Relevance:</strong> The Normative Media Theories may seem a bit redundant with the proliferation of new media. But they still help understand the government-corporate owners-society equations. </p>

                <div class="imagePanel"><img src="assets/images/shaw.png" alt="Donald Shaw"><br></div>
		            <p>&nbsp;</p>
		            <p><strong>Theorist:</strong> The concept of Gatekeeping has its origins in Kurt Zadek Lewin’s studies in social psychology conducted in late 19th century. </p>
		            <p>&nbsp;</p>
		            <p><strong>Theory Development:</strong> McCombs &amp; Shaw in 1970s linked the Gatekeeping concept to agenda setting by the media. </p>
		            <p>&nbsp;</p>
		            <p><strong>Theory Explanation:</strong> Gatekeeping in media is the selection of news based on the salience of the news and a particular media's in-house agenda. In short, it is the news evaluation and filtering process in a news organization.  </p>
		            <p>&nbsp;</p>
		            <p>There are four levels of gatekeeping – </p>
		            <p>at the reporter’s level; </p>
		            <p>the sub-editor/editor’s level; </p>
		            <p>the advertiser’s level; </p>
		            <p>and the media owner’s level. </p>
		            <p>&nbsp;</p>
		            <p><strong>Theory Application/Relevance:</strong> Gatekeeping is now an accepted part of media in the dissemination of information and news. It has also become part of organizational language where the management uses gatekeeping in its communications with its employees. </p>

                <div class="imagePanel2"><img src="assets/images/frankfurt.png" width="85%" alt="Frankfurt"></div>
			        <p>&nbsp;</p>
			        <p><strong>Theorists:</strong> Five theorists from Frankfurt were chiefly responsible for establishing Critical Theory as a specific strand of thought: Herbert Marcuse, Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, and, slightly later, Jürgen Habermas </p>
			        <p>&nbsp;</p>
			        <p><strong>Concept Explanation:</strong> The political turmoil of Germany's troubled interwar years greatly affected the Frankfurt School's development. Its thinkers were particularly influenced by the failure of the working-class revolution in Western Europe (precisely where Marx had predicted that a communist revolution would take place) and by the rise of Nazism in such an economically and technologically advanced nation as Germany. </p>
			        <p>&nbsp;</p>
			        <p>The mass media, like all other industries in capitalist society, produces and sells a commodity. However, the commodity produced and sold is not what most people think it is. The commodity produced and sold is not the program or product nor is it the advertisement. &quot;The most intimate reactions of human beings have been so thoroughly reified that the idea of anything specific to themselves now persists only as an utterly abstract notion: personality scarcely signifies anything more than shining white teeth and freedom from body odour and emotions. </p>
			        <p>&nbsp;</p>
			        <p>The triumph of advertising in the culture industry is that consumers feel compelled to buy and use its products even though they see through them,&quot; argued Adorno and Horkheimer. It was thus an era of mass production and consumption characterized by uniformity and homogeneity of needs, thought, and behavior producing a mass society and what the Frankfurt School described as 'the end of the individual'. </p>
			        <p>&nbsp;</p>
			        <p>No longer was individual thought and action the motor of social and cultural progress; instead giant organizations and institutions overpowered individuals. The era corresponds to the staid, conformist, and conservative world of corporate capitalism that was dominant in the 1950s with its organization men and women, its mass consumption, and its mass culture. Mass culture and communication generated a highly organized and massified social order. </p>
			        <p>&nbsp;</p>
			        <p>Thus, the Frankfurt School theorized a 'culture industry' in which mass consumption and mass culture produced a consumer society based on homogeneous needs and desires for mass-produced products and a mass society based on social organization and homogeneity. It is culturally the era of highly controlled network radio and television, insipid top forty pop music, glossy Hollywood films, national magazines, and other mass-produced cultural artifacts.</p>

			        <p>&nbsp;</p>
			        <p><strong>Theorist:</strong> Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman came up with this term in their analysis of the news media as a business, in 1988 </p>
			        <p>&nbsp;</p>
			        <p><strong>Theory Explanation:</strong> Manufacturing Consent takes off on the propaganda model of communication and states that corporate-owned news media are businesses that are subject to commercial competition for advertising revenue and profit. Talking in particular about American Media, Chomsky says that media have 'filters' in the form of owners, advertisers, news makers and news shapers, which together determine media content, often without dissenting voices.  </p>
			        <p>&nbsp;</p>
			        <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Chomsky's theory holds true to a large extent with hegemonic control over traditional media; however, that is changing with the proliferation of new media. </p>

		            <p>&nbsp;</p>
		            <p><strong>Theory Explanation:</strong> The CNN Effect has been theorized as the effect of the 24-hour news networks on the general political and economic environment of any region. The theory's origins are in the American 24-hour cable news channel CNN's coverage of some of the most significant events of the 1980s like the Gulf War, fall of the Berlin Wall, ethnic clashes in Bosnia, etc. Although much debated, CNN's over-the-top coverage of international events then is supposed to have flared up public opinion and influenced some American foreign policy decisions. The CNN Effect eventually came to refer to not just news on CNN but any 24-hour news channel transmitting dramatic, live images especially from conflict areas or those struck by natural disasters thereby influencing policy. </p>
		            <p>&nbsp;</p>
		            <p><strong>Theory Application/Relevance:</strong> The CNN Effect has been debunked more by administrators and legislators than academicians and theorists. Today, however, saturation coverage of war zones or calamities on television news networks appears to have dulled the senses of the viewers. </p>

			        <p><strong>Theorist: </strong>Walter Lippman first talked about it in 1922 </p><br>
			        <p><strong>Theory Development:</strong> Maxwell McCombs &amp; Donald L. Shaw formalized it in 1972 </p><br>
		          <p><strong>Theory Explanation:</strong> Because we depend on the media for information, media has the power to decide what is more important, or what is more salient. This function of deciding the salience is called agenda setting. Agenda setting is done due to several reasons, political as well as commercial. By using gatekeeping (filtering) and framing, the media shapes the news as per their agenda. This may or may not represent the complete truth. Thus, by concentrating on selected news and by reframing it, media persuades the audience to believe in the salience of some issues over others. </p>
			        <p>&nbsp;</p>
			        <p>Rogers and Dearing identify three types of agenda setting:<br>
			          1) Public agenda setting 		<br>
			          2) Media agenda setting 		<br>
			          3) Policy agenda setting<br>
                  	<br>
                  	<strong>Theory Application/Relevance:</strong> Media agenda is generally evident in news pertaining to politics, foreign affairs, history, medical news, etc.<br><br>

	                <strong>This is more of a concept than a theory</strong></strong><br>
			          <br>
		            Priming is a concept in psychology which states that responses to a stimulus might be based on exposure to a prior stimulus. The memory is thus 'primed' to respond to the stimulus based on earlier experience. The human brain is thus, primed to notice things that it would normally overlook because of the new knowledge it has acquired.<br><br>
                    Shanto Iyengar, Mark Peters &amp; Donald Kinder coined the term Priming Theory for media in 1982.<br>
                    Theory Explanation: For believers of the Priming Theory, media has the power to control and influence how the viewers will understand and interpret the new information. This theory should be studied in conjunction with other theories like Agenda Setting, Persuasion and Manufacturing Consent<br><br>
                    <strong>Theory Application/Relevance:</strong> The priming theory has relevance in news pertaining to politics and current affairs, as well as commercial advertisements<br>

		            <p><strong>Theorists:</strong> Several media researchers have theorized about Framing of news or issues by the media, prominent among them are Todd Gitlin (1980), Shanto Iyengar (1990) and Fairhurst &amp; Sarr (1996). </p>
		            <p>&nbsp;</p>
		            <p><strong>Theory Explanation:</strong> Framing is the way the media presents the events and issues they cover and the way the audience interprets them. Framing is the way media focuses attention on certain events, individuals and issues, and leads the public to 'look' at them from within a 'frame' set out by the media. Framing is done based on the agenda set by the media organization. Hence, framing theory has to be studied in conjunction with the Agenda Setting Theory. Framing as an aspect of Agenda Setting Theory has been studied in various connected fields including communications and media studies, psychology, anthropology and sociology. </p>
		            <p>&nbsp;</p>
		            <p>Shanto Iyengar theorized about two frames:  <br>
		              <br>
	                Episodic Frames: where news is narrowly framed and over time the issue gets trivialized in public discourse. The news with an episodic frame does not have an in-depth story or analysis. You may relate this with 'Parachute Journalism'.  <br>
	                <br>
	                Thematic Frames: where news is framed in a more abstract, wider frame giving a deeper view of issues. You may relate this with 'Immersion Journalism'.  <br>
	                <br>
	                <strong>	                Theory Application/Relevance:</strong> Framing Theory is used in political campaigns, advertising, corporate news, government policies, etc. </p>

	              <br>
	              <strong>Theorist</strong>:</strong> George Gerbner originally proposed the theory in the 1960s </p>
		          <p>&nbsp;</p>
		          <p><strong>Theory Development:</strong> Gerbner along with Gross further expanded the theory in 1976. </p>
		          <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><strong>Theory Explanation: </strong>This is a media effects theory which falls under the stalagmite theories (Black et.al.). The cultivation theory proposes that the media 'cultivates' or slowly builds viewers' perceptions of reality, by repeatedly providing content that they think should be given. Television has long-term effects on viewers' attitudes, though not so much in their behavior. </p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Gerbner categorized TV viewers as 'heavy viewers' (those who watched more than four hours of TV in a day) and 'light viewers' (those who watched less than four hours of TV in a day). He theorized that heavy watchers tend to believe that the world, as shown on television is the real world rather than a represented world. The researchers also state that the media does not create new attitudes and beliefs, but strengthens the pre-existing ones.   </p>

		            <p><strong>Theorist:</strong> Phillip J. Tichenor, George A. Donohue and Clarice N. Olien proposed the theory in the 1970s </p>
	              <p>&nbsp;</p>
		            <p><strong>Theory Explanation:</strong> The Knowledge Gap Theory / Hypothesis proposes that just like the other forms of wealth, the distribution of knowledge in the society is also differential; meaning, some people have more knowledge than others. Mass media messages tend to increase the gap between people from higher socio-economic segments of the society and those from the lower socio-economic strata. In other words, it suggests that people in higher income groups have access to more information, and are thus able to process information better because of their higher education levels; and that people in lower income groups remain poorer in knowledge because they do not have easy access to information. The theory establishes that infusion of media messages only work to widen this gap between the rich and the poor as more information enters a society.</p>
		            <p>&nbsp;</p>
		            <p><strong>Theory Application/Relevance:</strong> Understanding the knowledge gap in society helps in targetting specific audiences for specific messages.  </p>

			        <p><strong>Theory Development:</strong> Media Richness Theory did not initially consider the new media, but was later incorporated into its framework. The theory is more relevant today considering the extensive usage of new media and the Internet.  </p>

			        <p><strong>Theory Explanation:</strong> Media Richness Theory (MRT) is also called the Information Richness theory. It is a framework that is used to describe how well media can reproduce information. The assumption is that the richer the capacity of the medium to transmit multiple symbolic cues without loss of information or distortion, the better the communication. For example, face-to-face communication is considered the richest medium, while online text-based communication is said to be less rich than other media such as the telephone and video-conferencing. The theory was originally used to explain the efficiency of communication in organisations.<br>

			        <p>&nbsp;</p>
			        <p><strong>Theorist:</strong> Joshua Meyrowitz was the first to coin the term Medium Theory in 1985. Long before Meyrowitz, however, it was Marshall McLuhan who in 1963 talked about the transformative effects of the medium on people's lives. </p>
		          	<p>&nbsp;</p>
			        <p><strong>Theory Explanation:</strong> Meyrowitz prefers to use 'Medium Theory' rather than 'Media Theory' mainly because what makes it different from most other media theories is its focus on the characteristics of each individual medium or of each particular type of media. Medium theorists are interested in differentiating among media. Broadly speaking, media theorists ask: what are the relatively fixed features of each means of communicating and how do these features make the medium physically, psychologically, and socially different from other media and face-to-face interaction? 
			        <p>
			        <p>The Medium Theory, instead of treating media in general, studies a specific medium, and its contribution to social change. Marshall LcLuhan revolutionized media studies when he famously said, &quot;Medium is the message&quot;. McLuhan believed that the introduction of any new media changes the way people live. Thus, Medium Theory focuses on the technological aspects of media rather than on the content; and the social impact of that technology.                                         
			        <p>&nbsp;</p>
			        <p><strong>Theory Application/Relevance:</strong> The Medium Theory is retains its relevance and with the constantly evolving new media technologies; the theory helps to understand the cultural transformation of the new media world. </p>

		          <p>&nbsp;</p>
			        <p><strong>Theory Explanation:</strong> Spiral of Silence theory describes the process by which people who feel that their opinion is in a minority against the dominant majority opinion, tend to keep silent and do not speak up because of fear of isolation, and perhaps, ridicule. Neumann says that people have an intuitive sense or a 'quasi-statistical organ' to gauge prevailing public opinion. The closer their own opinion is to the perceived public opinion, the more likely they are to voice their opinion; and if they find their views/opinions to be different from popular opinion, they tend to remain silent. </p>

                    <img src="assets/images/spiralofsilence.png" width="95%" alt="Spiral of Silence">
					<p>Neumann theorized that mass media tends to deepen the spiral by influencing popular opinion. </p>
			        <p>&nbsp;</p>
			        <p><strong>Theory Application/Relevance:</strong> The Spiral of Silence is more pronounced today in the virtual world where people on social networking sites tend to sway with majority opinion or 'likes' than risk being isolated by their online communities. </p>
